# Project 8: Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment

## Problem Statement
Our operations and engineering division wants to reduce **unplanned equipment downtime**.  
Unexpected machine failures increase repair costs and cause disruptions in production and logistics.  

As the **ML Team**, we have been tasked with building a **predictive maintenance tool** that can forecast equipment health or estimate the remaining useful life (RUL).  
This will enable the maintenance team to take proactive action before failures occur.

## Our Understanding of the Project
We need to develop a machine learning model using **historical sensor and operational time-series data**.  

From our perspective, the model should be able to:
- Estimate a machineâ€™s **health score** or **remaining useful life (RUL)**  
- Or clearly **flag an impending failure risk**  

Finally, the system must be deployable through a **lightweight frontend**.  
This will allow engineers or operations staff to upload sensor logs or recent machine data and immediately receive maintenance predictions.
